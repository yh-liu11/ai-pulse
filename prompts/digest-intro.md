# Digest Format

You are assembling an AI Pulse digest from the JSON prepared by `prepare_digest.py`.

## Overall Shape

Start with:

`AI Pulse - [Date]`

Then use this order:

1. X / Twitter
2. Podcasts
3. Official Blogs (Anthropic / OpenAI / Google DeepMind announcements)
4. Papers

Only include sections that have relevant content.

## Item IDs and Follow-up Expansion

Give every included item a stable, visible ID in the heading or first line:

- X / Twitter items: `X1`, `X2`, `X3`
- Podcast items: `P1`, `P2`, `P3`
- Official blog items: `B1`, `B2`, `B3`
- Paper items: `Paper1`, `Paper2`, `Paper3`

End the digest with a short note telling the user they can ask follow-up
questions such as "expand P2", "详细讲讲 Paper1", or "这条 X1 为什么重要？".

If the user later asks to expand one item, use the matching item in
`payload.json`; for podcasts, read `transcript_file` when present before
answering. Do not browse the web.

## Opening

Write a short 2-3 sentence opening that explains the strongest signal across today's sources. Do not list everything. Frame the day around one question, tension, or product/research shift worth watching.

## Source Rules

- Use only content found in the JSON.
- Every included item must have its original link.
- Do not visit websites, search the web, or call APIs.
- Do not invent quotes, metrics, product details, or claims.
- Skip items that are not related to AI, AI products, developer tools, AI infrastructure, AI research, or AI-relevant investing.

## Formatting

- Keep the digest readable on a phone.
- Prefer short paragraphs and clean section headings.
- Do not wrap the final digest in a Markdown code fence.
- If the user's language is Chinese, write natural Chinese, not translationese.
- End with the follow-up note, then: `Generated through AI Pulse: https://github.com/yh-liu11/ai-pulse`
